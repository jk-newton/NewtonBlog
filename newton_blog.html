<h1>Welcome to the Jason and Mackenzie Newton Blog for Dec 2022</h1>

<p>
This year we got married on May 28th. It was off. the. hook.
We spent our honeymoon in Cancun, Mexico and had a blast. We moved into our apartment
in Chandler, Arizona and have been living there ever since. Jason has been working at
Northrop Grumman and Mackenzie has been going to school online at University of Illinois
in Instructional Design.

Happy Christmas
